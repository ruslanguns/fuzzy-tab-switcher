# Fuzzy Tab Switcher

A high-performance tab switcher focused on speed and keyboard navigation. Replaces the default browser tab cycling with a fuzzy search interface that searches across all open windows.

## Core Logic & Features

- **Intelligent Fuzzy Search**: Custom scoring algorithm that matches against both Title and URL (`Title` vs `URL` weighting). Prioritizes sequential matches and word boundaries.
- **Cross-Window Context**: Queries `browser.tabs` globally, allowing seamless switching effectively treating the entire browser session as a single workspace.
- **MRU Sorting**: Uses `historySignal` to track access patterns. Results are sorted by:
  1.  Fuzzy Match Score
  2.  Last Access Time (Most Recently Used)
- **Privacy**: Zero external requests. All history state is persisted in `browser.storage.local`.

## Technical Stack

Built with a modern, compile-to-JS toolchain for performance and maintainability:

- **State Management**: Preact Signals for fine-grained reactivity.
- **UI Framework**: Preact (lightweight React alternative).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (bundled via Vite).
- **Build System**: Vite.
